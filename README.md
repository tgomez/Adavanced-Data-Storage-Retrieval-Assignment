<h2> Step 1 - Data Engineering </h2>

<p>In Step 1 I utilized jupyter notebooks and pandas to read in 2 CSV files as data frames, cleaned up the files and saved then with the prefix 'clean_'. </p>

<h2> Step 2 - Database Engineering </h2>

<p> In Step 2 I utilized jupyter notebooks and pandas to read in the cleaned CSVs. I created a database 'hawaii.sqlite', defined ORM classes and created tables in the database. </p>

<h2> Step 3 - Climate Analysis and Exploration </h2>

<p> Step 3 was carried out in a jupyter notebook 'climate_analysis.ipynb'. For the this project I chose a time frame of August 1-7 for analysis in this assignment. I then utilized SQLAlchemy automap_base() to reflect tables into classes and saved these as references as 'Station' and 'Measurement'. </p>

<h2> Step 3a Precipitation Analysis </h2>
